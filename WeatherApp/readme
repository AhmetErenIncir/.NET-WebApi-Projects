Weather API Project üå§Ô∏è

This is a basic web API project aimed at connecting a frontend (HTML/JavaScript) to a backend (.NET) using RESTful APIs. The project is in its early stages and will be developed further with additional features.

Project Overview
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
	‚Ä¢	Backend: .NET Web API
	‚Ä¢	Goal: To create a simple web app where users can fetch weather data by interacting with the backend API.

Future Development Plans

Phase 1: Database Integration
	‚Ä¢	Add database connectivity to store and manage weather data.

Phase 2: Interactive Map Feature
	‚Ä¢	Integrate an interactive map on the client side to allow users to select a city.
	‚Ä¢	Consider using React for building this interactive map.

How to Run the Project
	1.	Backend:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.
	‚Ä¢	Navigate to the backend project directory and run:

dotnet run


	‚Ä¢	The API will be available at http://localhost:5048.

	2.	Frontend:
	‚Ä¢	Open the index.html file in your browser or use a local server (e.g., Live Server for VS Code).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the frontend connects to the correct backend endpoint.

API Endpoints

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/weather	Fetch weather data

Dependencies
	‚Ä¢	Backend: .NET 6 / 7 / 8 (depending on your version)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Plain HTML & JavaScript (React planned for future updates)

Future Improvements
	‚Ä¢	City-based weather search via an interactive map.
	‚Ä¢	Improved UI with React.
	‚Ä¢	Database-driven weather data storage.
